Channels
========

*Channels* are integrations with external services that can act as
:doc:`trigger` or :doc:`action` in a :doc:`receipt`.

Developing a channel
--------------------

First of all a channel must inherit the core.Channel class and implement its
methods. But there are a few more things to consider.

URL endpoints
"""""""""""""

Every channel will need some way to authenticate the user against the external
service. Therefore it should have a view called ``authenticate``. It is
recommended to call this url endpoint ``/authenticate`` but it does not
necessarily need to, since internal linking is done via django url aliases::

    # urls.py

    # Don't forget the appname!
    app_name="channel_instagram"

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^authenticate', views.AuthView.as_view(), name='authenticate'),
        ...
    ]
